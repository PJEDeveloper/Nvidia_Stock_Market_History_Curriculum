# NVIDIA Stock Forecasting with Deep Learning & Sentiment Integration

This open-source project implements an **end-to-end reproducible machine learning pipeline** for **time series forecasting of NVIDIA stock prices**, combining deep learning sequence models, multi-lookback training, ensemble meta-modeling, and integration of **news sentiment via FinBERT**.  

The work was developed as a staged, multi-week pipeline culminating in a full **capstone system** with exogenous confidence scoring.
